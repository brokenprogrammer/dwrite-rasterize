# dwrite-rasterize

This is a DirectWrite based rasterizer. The intention of this project is to provide a sample of using DirectWrite in order to rasterize glyphs into a bitmap that can later be used to build a texture atlas of the font.

This repository will act as a playground for me while I work with DWrite and maybe in the future other implementations and try to improve the solution.

## Building

Navigate to the `src` directory of this project and run `build.bat`. This assumes the machine has Visual Studio buildtools installed.
